## Introduction:
*  This SOP is meant to educate Members on the procedures and policies that are in place for HAZTEAM. All Members
are required to know this SOP. Failure to know them and as a result violate them, is grounds for expulsion from
the team.
*  In HT we hold our members to a higher standard. That is to understand and uphold a specific etiquette that must
be followed as a member of the team. We don't believe our rules are strict or are hard to follow, but nevertheless
they are rules which must be followed for the betterment of the team.
*  The most basic rules for all members are based on common courtesy and respect for other members and nonmembers alike. As an advancing team in the online community, our interactions with others are many and these
are what make up the reputation of our team in the gaming world.

## Chain of Command:
*  We have a ruling body designated as the Council that consists of our clan Leaders and veteran members to ensure
the administration, organization and everyday operations run smoothly. If you have an inquiry, issue, or even an
accolade, please contact a Council Member.
*  In addition to the Council members, we also have System Administrators. These are individuals that volunteer
their time to assist in the maintenance and upkeep of our game server(s), website and Discord. If a clan Member
encounters a technical problem with game server, the website or Discord, they should be directed to a System
Administrator. These individuals can be identified on the Crew Roster.

## Nymesis’ Open Door Policy:
*  Those of you that are former military know what this is. For civilians, an explanation: A Commander's Open Door
policy is in place for when a member of the team has a problem or issue that they do not feel comfortable talking
to their immediate supervisor or chain of command about. They can come directly to Nymesis and he can handle
the problem.
*  In our current command structure, the only chain of command is the Council. If you do not feel you can resolve
your problem with them or don't feel comfortable talking to them, again, you can direct your issue to Nymesis.

## General Orders:
1. **Let your actions speak louder than your words.**
Anyone can talk smack, but not everyone can give a good butt kickin'. Don't make yourself and the team look like
a punk by talking smack and not being able to follow up on it. If you're good, then that's great. But don't be cocky.
Just let your good skills speak louder than your words. And just maybe, at the end of the battle, your opponent will
respect you more.
2. **Treat others as you would want to be treated.**
Most people want to be treated with dignity and respect. Try and remember this simple, yet thoughtful golden rule.
If you don't, then you have no business being associated with HT.
3. **Don't let us catch you cheating.**
This is a very touchy subject with us. SWAT3 had tons of hacks in the later part of HT's reign in the community, and
it really got annoying and just plain sad. Our opinion on the matter is, just don't do it.
4. **Set the HAZTEAM example.**
Be an example. Set a standard. You should not only strive for this in HAZTEAM, but also in your everyday lives.
Push yourself to be the best you can be.
So, just be an example, not only to your fellow teammates, but the entire community and in your everyday lives.
What's the worst that can happen? That it sets you up for success? Set the HAZTEAM example!!

## Tags:
*  The official HT tags are: `=HT=`
*  If you are wearing your tags as a guest in any server you are expected to act in accordance with HAZTEAM SOP.
*  If you are not a clan Member, you are not allowed to wear our tags.

## Attitude:
*  Attitude is everything. Members & Moderators are held to a higher standard than other clans. We are to show
respect, courtesy, honor, and skill at all times. We are not here to cheat, cuss, harass or degrade other people.
*  There are going to be times when you get angry with another member, MOD, or fellow teammate. How you handle
yourself in these situations will be a direct reflection of HT, and your future with HT. We will NOT tolerate any
disrespect to any fellow members, Moderators or community members.
*  If you are having a problem with a fellow member or MOD, please DO NOT get into an altercation with them. Simply
leave and cool down. We call it the “24 Hour Rule”. Take 24 hours and once you cool down and come back, try to
handle the situation with maturity and respect. If you are still having problems, please go to a Council Member for
help.
*  Do not ever call out or disrespect someone VIA the non-pass worded forums. If you have a complaint about how
someone handled a situation, you may submit a thread in the PROTECTED ‘member section’ of the forums. There
is no need to let the public know about our internal disagreements or problems. Basically, keep our internal issues
IN HOUSE. Additionally, if it’s a simply misunderstanding, chances are it can be worked out with a PM or email
without having to blow it out of proportion and have all the drama that consequently is involved.
*  Harassment. Defined as taunting, name calling, degrading or humiliating individuals. This negative treatment will
not be tolerated in HAZTEAM, period. A person exhibiting this type of behavior will be warned. If the behavior
continues, they will suffer the possible consequences as defined by our established SOP and Rules. See below.

## Prospective Members:
*  If someone is interested in joining HT, then they need to first notify us that they are interested by filling out our
Mentorship Request Form, found on our website. This form will be automatically posted in the forums as a new
thread. Next, a mentor will be assigned to the interested party and the individual’s website rank will be updated to
“Recruit”.
*  Mentorship Program: This route to membership is used to determine the interested individual’s attitude, maturity,
levelheadedness and overall quality of the person. We assign a Member of the team as their Mentor who will game
with them and show them the ways of HAZTEAM by example. A Mentor will have at least one year time in service
as a Member.
Be advised, it is the Mentor’s responsibility to post on the forums when they officially started mentoring the
prospective member, which should alleviate any confusion at a later date. The Mentorship timeframe is a sliding
scale and can be as short or as long as the Mentor deems necessary.
*  The Nihta Directive: This directive is used when a Leader or Council member issue an invite to a person(s) they
deem HT membership quality, thereby deviating from the normal mentorship process because they have already
mentored the particular individual themselves. The Leader or Council member whom issues The Nihta Directive
shall take full accountability and responsibility for the new member. 

## Voting Procedures:
*  The minimum number of votes required for membership is 1/3 of the total number of members at the time of the
vote.

### Voting Process:
  * When a vote for membership is required, it should be done in our forum’s ‘Voting Booth’ section. Please use
the following selections for the “thread options”:
```
Thread Options: Poll
Poll Options:
- Poll Type: Single Vote
- Who can vote: Members
- Question: Player XYZ for Membership?
- Answers:
  * Yes
  * No (please explain why)
  * Don't know them
```
* All “No” votes must be explained so If a member votes NO, an explanation is required in the thread. If not,
then the “extra” NO votes that do not match the number of NO posts will then be thrown out of the vote.
* Only Nymesis or AJZ can approve a vote and finalize it. In the absence of the Leaders for 10 days after the
1/3 team vote, a Council Member may approve and finalize the vote.
* Only Nymesis or AJZ can direct a Member to post an Invite Thread. This invite thread should be reserved for
the new member’s Mentor. In the absence of the Leaders for 10 days after the 1/3 team vote, a Council
Member may direct a Member to post an invite announcement.

## HT Rules:
*  All members are responsible for adhering to the following Standard Operating Procedures of the HAZTEAM
website.
*  This is a **gaming** website and Discord. Any posts, threads or polls relating to religion, politics, terrorism, drugs,
sexually explicit content, hacks or torrents could be deemed as inappropriate and viewed as abuse.
*  Any posts, threads or polls that are disrespectful, hurtful, unkind, degrading or otherwise perceived to be such
could also be deemed as inappropriate and an abuse.
*  Any posts, threads or polls that are considered spam, completely unrelated to a topic or created for the purpose of
raising post counts could be deemed as inappropriate.
*  The website or Discord is not a venue for recruiting or soliciting for NON HT teams, clans, groups or organizations.
Any posts, threads or polls relating to such content could be deemed inappropriate.
*  Any member that is the author of a post, thread or poll which is deemed "inappropriate" by a Moderator or
Administrator could be suspended for an amount of time the Administrator deems necessary.
*  In the event a member continues to post, create threads or polls that are deemed inappropriate and/or abuse the
website/Discord, their entire network will be banned along with their username until an Administrator removes
said ban.
*  In the event a member has an issue with a thread, post or poll you should simply report the post to a Leader,
Admin or Council member for review.
*  If a member disagrees with any action that is taken toward them, their account or their content on the
website/Discord, they may contact any one of the Administrators.
*  In the event a member has been issued a second bad conduct, incident warning due to negative and/or abusive
behavior, as outlined in HT code of conduct, rules and/or policies, then they become subject to at least one-month
probationary period. Additionally, a possible longer period could be enforced depending on the offense. In the
event the member continues the negative behavior and is involved in a third incident, they are dishonorably
discharged from the team. “Three strikes, you’re out.”

## Clan Matches and/or Challenges:
*  Any requests for a clan match, tournament or challenge are required to be forwarded to Nymesis or AJZ. In their
absence, the request should be redirected to a Council member. 

## Advancement In Rank - Beyond The Enlisted Ranks:
*  Once a member reaches their two year promotion/anniversary date with the team, they will have a choice to make regarding
their future advancement opportunites from the three options below.
*  1.  ``Line Officer``:  The member may choose to leave the senior enlisted ranks and move into Command, or the Line Officer
route, being promoted to Ensign.
*  2.  ``Warrant Officer``:  A WO is considered to be a "specialist" in their field.  It's typical for senior enlisted personnel
to move into the WO route to further specialize in their technical expertise, especially if the individual is not interested
in Command responsibilites.  If a member chooses the WO route after two years, they will move into the WO route, with ranks 
consisting of WO-1 through WO-5.
*  3.  ``Master Chief Petty Officer``:  A member may choose to stay in the senior enlisted ranks at MCPO, however, remaining at this rank
will not allow for future promotions.
